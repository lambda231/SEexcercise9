Exercise 1 - Equivalence partitioning and Boundary Value Analysis
Description:
  A savings account in a bank earns a different rate of interest depending on the balance in the account. The interest rate will be calculated basing on the current balance of customers. If a balance in the range $0 up to $100 has a 3% interest rate, a balance over $100 and up to $1000 has a 5% inter-est rate, and balances of $1000 and over have a 7% interest rate. For example:
  calculateInterest(150) --> 5%
Task:
  Identify test cases using equivalence partitions and boundary value.
  Test case for input: 50, 500, 999, 1200, 100, 1000


Exercise 2 - Path Testing
  Description: consider the program below
    int randomfunction(x,y,z){
      if x ≠ 0 then y := 5;
      else z := z – x;
      end if;
      if z > 1 then z := z / x;
      else z := 0;
      end if;
      return (x+y+z)
    }
  Task: 
    1. Construct the control flow graph of the code above
	   x != 0 => y = 5      => z > 1 => z = z/x  => return (x+y+z)
	   else	  => z = z - x     else => z = 0
    2. Identify a minimum number of test cases to achieve:
          2a. Statement coverage: every possible statement is covered: 2
          2b. Path coverage: every possible combination of logical branches is covered: 4

Exercise 3: Use case testing
	Write two test cases for a function Login of a eLearning portal, one for a succesful login and one for unsuccesful login. The login page has two fields: username, password and two buttons: Submit and Reset.
	Use the template below:
      Test case name/id  			: Login (Correct)
      Related screens 				:
      Pre-conditions	  			: 
      Actions						: Press Login
      Inputs						: Input username and password (correct)
      Expected Outputs 			    : Accept login
      Testing environment			:


	  Test case name/id  			: Login (False)
      Related screens 				:
      Pre-conditions	  			: 
      Actions						: Press Login
      Inputs						: Input username and password (wrong)
      Expected Outputs 			    : Deny access
      Testing environment			:
